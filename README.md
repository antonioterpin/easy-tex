This project was originally equipped with a backend deployed on Google Cloud and released in closed beta after a fun weekend hackathon with [Seif](https://github.com/vateseif). We wanted to try it out the new OpenAI GPT API. Fun stuff!

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), we would be glad you would actually integrate a similar concept!
